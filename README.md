# AGENTleBot

## Introduction

AGENTleBot, a Gentle (Agent) Bot, is designed to autonomously execute tasks with integrated memory and functional capabilities. This project draws inspiration from advanced AI Agent frameworks like BabyAGI and AutoGPT, aiming to provide a solution for automated task handling.

This project is primarily an exercise in exploring autonomous AI agents.

### Features

- **Integrated Vector Memory:** The bot retains information and learns from its interactions, enhancing its decision-making over time using a Pinecone Vector Index.
- **Multi Chain of Thought:** This bot has both internal monologues and external dialogues, allowing it to think and speak simultaneously to better accomplish tasks.
- **Customizable Objectives:** Users can set specific goals for the bot, directing its focus and actions accordingly.
